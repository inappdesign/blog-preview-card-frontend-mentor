## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I've done a few tutorials on CSS and I realise just how much I can forget until I am challenged to remember it. Specifically, I completely forgot about object-fit, which I needed to match the mobile figma design.

### Continued development

I look forward to my next Frontend Mentor challenge.
